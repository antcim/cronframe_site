# Getting Started

To use the framework in your Rust project:
```sh
$ cargo add cronframe
```

The linkme crate is required for macros to work (more recent versions of linkme might also work).
```sh
$ cargo add linkme@0.3.26
```

If you prefer to get it from [GitHub](https://github.com/antcim/cronframe/releases) it is highly advised to download the code from a release rather then cloning the repo.
